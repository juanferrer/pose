# pose
A free 2D skeleton-based animation tool aimed at indie gamedevs.

Create 2D animations using dopesheets in the editor and play them in your game by adding a Pose runtime to your game. 

Pose is in full development: the functional core is there, so it's fully possible to make animations, but there is still a long list of features to be added to make your life easier. This is currently the main focus of my efforts.

There is a single runtime, which is for MonoGame (https://www.monogame.net) . But, for programmers, porting the runtime code to another engine/language should not be difficult. It's in the runtimes folder of the code.

As the editor still needs a lot of work in the programming department, there are no manuals yet. That will come if once I consider the editor to be more ready for public use.
