# pose
A free 2D skeleton-based animation tool aimed at indie gamedevs.

Pose is in full development: the functional core is there and is usable, but a decent amount of small features making your life easier are still missing.

You can create animations using dopesheets and load them in your game using a Pose runtime. There is only a runtime for MonoGame at the moment. But, for programmers, porting the code to another engine/language should not be difficult.

Currently, all my effort goes into the programming, so there are no tutorials or manuals yet. I will address those aspects once the software reaches the minimum featureset to be used.
